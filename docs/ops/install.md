# Installation

## Status: not on PyPI yet

`pip install file-password-remover` is the intended install and is **not live
yet** — the project has not been published to PyPI. The release workflow is
already configured to publish it through PyPI Trusted Publishing, so this
section changes the day that runs. Until then, use one of the routes below.

Because the name is unclaimed, treat any package called
`file-password-remover` appearing on PyPI before this note is removed as not
ours.

## From the repository

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/Jayanth-reflex/fpr
```

Or with pip, which also gives you `fpr-gui` and the Python API:

```bash
pip install "file-password-remover @ git+https://github.com/Jayanth-reflex/fpr"
```

Python 3.10 or newer. Add 7-Zip support — a separate extra because `py7zr` is
LGPL-2.1-or-later and the default install stays permissive
([ADR-0006](../adr/0006-optional-lgpl-sevenzip-extra.md)):

```bash
pip install "file-password-remover[sevenzip] @ git+https://github.com/Jayanth-reflex/fpr"
```

Pin to a release rather than `main` for anything you depend on:

```bash
pip install "file-password-remover @ git+https://github.com/Jayanth-reflex/fpr@v1.0.0"
```

## Once it is on PyPI

```bash
pip install file-password-remover
pip install "file-password-remover[sevenzip]"
pipx install file-password-remover
```

### Hash-pinned, for a locked-down environment

```bash
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
```

Generate the lock file yourself — do not trust one you did not produce:

```bash
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file requirements.lock pyproject.toml
```

## Docker

The image exists because the [threat model](../security/threat-model.md)'s R-08
says the parsers are not sandboxed and recommends processing untrusted files in
a container. This is that container.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/jayanth-reflex/file-password-remover:latest
```

Pass `--user` so the output belongs to you rather than to the image's uid, and
mount the directory you are working in:

```bash
# Inspect -- no password needed, nothing written
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/data" --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  ghcr.io/jayanth-reflex/file-password-remover inspect /data/report.pdf

# Remove -- the password goes in over stdin, never in argv
printf '%s' "$PASSWORD" | docker run --rm -i -v "$PWD:/data" \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  ghcr.io/jayanth-reflex/file-password-remover \
  remove /data/report.pdf --password-stdin
```

Add `--network none` to make the "it never uploads anything" claim something
the kernel enforces rather than something you take on trust:

```bash
docker run --rm --network none -v "$PWD:/data" --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  ghcr.io/jayanth-reflex/file-password-remover inspect /data/report.pdf
```

The image runs as a non-root user, contains no build toolchain, and
deliberately omits `py7zr`, so `.7z` is not supported inside it
([ADR-0006](../adr/0006-optional-lgpl-sevenzip-extra.md)). If you need it:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/jayanth-reflex/file-password-remover
USER root
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir py7zr
USER fpr
```

### Verifying the image

Images are built, run and *tested* before they are pushed — the workflow
decrypts a PDF, a DOCX and a ZIP inside the image and checks that a wrong
password still exits 3 — then signed with cosign keyless signing:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/jayanth-reflex/file-password-remover:latest \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/Jayanth-reflex/fpr/' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

## Standalone bundle (no Python needed)

Download the archive for your platform from the
[releases page](https://github.com/Jayanth-reflex/fpr/releases),
then **verify it before running it**:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS      # macOS / Linux
certutil -hashfile file-password-remover-Windows-X64.zip SHA256   # Windows
```

| Platform | Archive | Unpack to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS (Apple silicon / Intel) | `…-macOS-ARM64.tar.gz` / `…-macOS-X64.tar.gz` | `~/Applications` or anywhere |
| Linux (glibc 2.28+) | `…-Linux-X64.tar.gz` | `~/.local/opt` |
| Windows 10+ | `…-Windows-X64.zip` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs` |

```bash
tar xzf file-password-remover-macOS-ARM64.tar.gz
./file-password-remover/fpr version
./file-password-remover/fpr-gui        # the desktop window
```

Put it on your `PATH` if you want to type `fpr` from anywhere:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s "$PWD/file-password-remover/fpr" ~/.local/bin/fpr
```

### The bundles are not signed

They are built by GitHub Actions and are **not** code-signed or notarised.
Signing needs an Apple Developer identity and a Windows code-signing
certificate, which this project does not hold; the steps are written up in
[release.md](release.md) for anyone who does.

Practical consequences:

- **macOS** shows *"cannot be opened because the developer cannot be
  verified"*. Right-click → **Open** once, or
  `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine file-password-remover/*`, after you have
  checked the SHA-256.
- **Windows** shows a SmartScreen warning. *More info* → *Run anyway*, after
  checking the hash.

If that is not acceptable in your environment — and it is a reasonable position
— use `pip install`, which verifies the package through PyPI instead.

## From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jayanth-reflex/fpr
cd file-password-remover
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev,sevenzip]"
make check
```

## Checking it works

```bash
fpr version     # version, platform, and every decryption dependency
fpr formats     # what is supported, what is refused, and the policy rules
```

End to end, with a file the tool generates itself so you are not testing with
anything of your own:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
from fpr.testing import fixtures as F
Path("demo.pdf").write_bytes(F.make_pdf(F.PdfSpec(user="demo-pw", owner="demo-owner")))
PY
printf 'demo-pw' | fpr remove demo.pdf --password-stdin
```

You should see a `verified encrypted=false, pages=3, …` line and a
`demo-unprotected.pdf` beside the original.

## Platform notes

**Linux.** Some distributions ship Python without Tk. If `fpr-gui` reports
`No module named 'tkinter'`, install it: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
(Debian/Ubuntu), `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter` (Fedora). The `fpr` command
does not need it.

**macOS.** The system Python at `/usr/bin/python3` works. If `fpr-gui` looks
wrong or fails to start, use a python.org or Homebrew Python — Apple's build of
Tk has historically lagged.

**Windows.** Use the official python.org installer or `winget install
Python.Python.3.12`. The Microsoft Store build sandboxes file access in ways
that make choosing files awkward.
